- Figure 3 
1. Open the **Fig3_as.m** file from _figures_ directory on Matlab software.
2. Set the variables 'path_to_directory' on the lines 5 (for Windows files with neurons 100% Excitatory with _Long Double_ precision), line 18 (for Windows files with neurons 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory with _Long Double_ precision), line 31 (for Windows files with neurons 100% Excitatory with _Boost_ precision) and line 31 (for Windows files with neurons 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory with _Boost_ precision).
3. Verify that the names of the files read are the same within the directories. Line 6 for neurons 100% Excitatory on Windows platform with _Long double_ precision, line 19 for neurons 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory on Windows platform with _Long double_ precision, Line 32 for neurons 100% Excitatory on Windows platform with _Boost_ precision, line 45 for neurons 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory on Windows platform with _Boost_ precision, 
4. Compile the file Fig3_as.m to generated the Figure 2 (Without the flowchart).
5. Change the file name (line 6, line 19, 32 and 45) to files with name dt = 0.05; and the variable dt (line 57) for 0.05 to generate the figure with dt = 0.05.
