**How to compile**
> If your platform is Windonws:
- Double
	1. Open the Double directory and compile the make file named *MakefileWin*		
	2. After this, make sure that your have
	3. Compile the HH_BBT2017_doubleP
	4. It will make four files inside the results directory, are they:
		4.1 HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,0,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES,Epis
		4.2 HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,0,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES,Iapp
		4.3 HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100,0,vI70,t=8s_double_IappDES
		4.4 HH_BBT_rk4_dt0100_100_0_vI_70_t8s_double_IappDES_Spikes
- LongDouble
	1. Open the Long Double directory and compile the make file named *MakefileWin*		
	2. After this, make sure that your have
	3. Compile the HH_BBT2017_LongDouble
- Boost
	1. Open the Boost directory and compile the make file named *MakefileWin*		
	2. After this, make sure that your have
	3. Compile the HH_BBT2017_Boost

> If your platform is Linux or MacOS:

> How compile the Figures

***After generated the archives for each platform and each precision***
- Figure 1
	1. Open the Matlab software and search for the directory preciosion 
- Figure 2 
- Figure 3 
- Figure 4 
- Figure 5
