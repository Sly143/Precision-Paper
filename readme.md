1. Open the Fig3_as.m file from **_figures_** directory on Matlab software.
2. Set the variables 'path_to_directory' on the lines 5 (for Windows files with neurons 100% Excitatory with _Long Double_ precision) and line 18 (for Windows files with neurons 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory)
3. Verify that the names of the files read are the same within the directories. Line 6 for neurons 100% Excitatory on Windows platform and line 19 for neurons 80/20% Excitatory/Inhibitory on Windows platform.
4. Compile the file Fig1_as.m to generated the Figure 2 (Without the flowchart).
5. Change the file name (line 6 and line 19) to files with name dt = 0.05; and the variable dt (line 31) for 0.05 to generate the figure with dt = 0.05.
